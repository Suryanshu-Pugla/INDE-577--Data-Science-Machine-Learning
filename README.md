- Provide clear explanations of machine learning algorithms.
- Serve as a reference for beginners and intermediate learners.
  
**2. Code Implementation:**
- Include Jupyter notebooks for each model with step-by-step implementations.
- Use real-world datasets to demonstrate practical applications.

**3. Model Analysis:**
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provide visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices, decision boundaries).

**Supervised Learning Models**

1. Linear Regression: Predict continuous outcomes.

2. Logistic Regression: Binary classification tasks.

3. Perceptron: Binary classification using single neuron.

4. Neural Networks: Dense neural networks for complex relationships.

5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classification and regression.

6. Decision Trees:Tree-based classification or regression.

7. Random Forest: Ensemble learning method for classification and regression.

8. Ensemble Methods: For improved Accuracy 

**Unsupervised Learning Models**

1. K-Means Clustering: Grouping data into clusters based on similarity.

2. Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN): Clustering with noise handling.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction for visualization or preprocessing.

4. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Matrix decomposition for dimensionality reduction or image compression.

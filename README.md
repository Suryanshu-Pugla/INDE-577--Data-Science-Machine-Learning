- Provide clear explanations of machine learning algorithms.
- Serve as a reference for beginners and intermediate learners.
  
**2. Code Implementation:**
- Include Jupyter notebooks for each model with step-by-step implementations.
- Use real-world datasets to demonstrate practical applications.

**3. Model Analysis:**
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provide visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices, decision boundaries).

**Supervised Learning Models**
1. Linear Regression: Predict continuous outcomes.
Example: Predicting house prices.

2. Logistic Regression: Binary classification tasks.
Example: Predicting whether a customer will purchase a product.

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classification and regression.
Example: Classifying wines based on chemical properties.

4. Decision Trees:Tree-based classification or regression.
Example: Predicting student performance.

5. Random Forest: Ensemble learning method for classification and regression.
Example: Predicting customer churn.

6. Neural Networks: Dense neural networks for complex relationships.
Example: Classifying handwritten digits.

**Unsupervised Learning Models**

1. K-Means Clustering: Grouping data into clusters based on similarity.
Example: Customer segmentation.

2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering): Clustering with noise handling.
Example: Identifying anomalies in datasets.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction for visualization or preprocessing.
Example: Visualizing high-dimensional datasets.

4. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Matrix decomposition for dimensionality reduction or image compression.
Example: Image compression tasks.

### **Overview of Ensemble Methods: Boosting**

---

### **What is Boosting?**
Boosting is an **ensemble learning technique** used to improve the accuracy of weak learners (e.g., decision trees). It works by combining multiple **sequential models**, where each model learns from the errors of its predecessor. Unlike bagging methods (e.g., Random Forest), boosting focuses on **reducing bias** and creating a strong learner by iteratively correcting mistakes made by weaker models.

Boosting is widely used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks and has proven to deliver high accuracy on complex datasets.

### **How Boosting Works**
Boosting works in the following steps:

1. **Initialize Weights**:
   - Assign equal weights to all training samples.

2. **Train Weak Learners**:
   - Sequentially train weak learners (e.g., shallow decision trees) on the dataset.
   - At each step, more weight is assigned to the misclassified samples, making the next weak learner focus on correcting those errors.

3. **Combine Learners**:
   - Each weak learner's prediction is weighted based on its performance.
   - The final prediction is obtained by aggregating the outputs of all weak learners.

4. **Iterate**:
   - Repeat the process for a specified number of iterations or until errors are minimized.

### **Mathematics Behind Boosting**
Boosting algorithms minimize a loss function by sequentially updating weights of training samples and combining weak learners.

#### **General Steps**:
1. Train a weak learner \( f_m(x) \) on weighted data.
2. Compute the error \( e_m \) on training data.
3. Calculate the weight of the weak learner:
   
   \[
   \alpha_m = \frac{1}{2} \log\left(\frac{1 - e_m}{e_m}\right)
   \]
   where \( e_m \) is the weighted error.

4. Update the weights of the training samples:
   
   \[
   w_{i}^{(m+1)} = w_{i}^{(m)} \cdot \exp(-\alpha_m y_i f_m(x_i))
   \]
   where \( y_i \) is the actual label, and \( f_m(x_i) \) is the weak learner's prediction.

The final model combines predictions from all weak learners:

\[
F(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m f_m(x)
\]

2. **Computationally Expensive**:
   - Training sequential models can be slow for large datasets.
3. **Overfitting**:
   - May overfit the training data if not properly regularized.
4. **Requires Careful Tuning**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimal performance.

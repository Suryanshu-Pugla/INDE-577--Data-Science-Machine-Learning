### **README: Linear Regression Algorithm**

---

### **Overview**
Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used **supervised learning algorithms** in machine learning. It is primarily used for **predicting a continuous target variable** based on one or more input features (independent variables). The goal of linear regression is to model the relationship between the input features and the target as a straight line (or a hyperplane in higher dimensions).

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Type of Algorithm**: Regression.
- **Output**: A continuous value.
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Based on the principle of least squares, which minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

### **Mathematics of Linear Regression**

#### **1. Linear Equation**
For a dataset with \( n \) features, the relationship is modeled as:
\[
 y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \ldots + w_nx_n + b
\]
Where:
- \( y \): Predicted output.
- \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \): Input features.
- \( w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n \): Weights (coefficients) of the features.
- \( b \): Bias (intercept).

For a single feature (simple linear regression), the equation reduces to:
\[
 y = w_1x_1 + b
\]

#### **2. Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)**
Linear regression minimizes the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to optimize the weights:
\[
 \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \big( y_i - \hat{y}_i \big)^2
\]
Where:
- \( m \): Number of training examples.
- \( y_i \): Actual target value for the \( i \)-th example.
- \( \hat{y}_i \): Predicted value for the \( i \)-th example.

#### **3. Optimization**
Weights (\( w \)) and bias (\( b \)) are optimized using **gradient descent** or by solving the normal equation:
\[
 w = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
\]

### **Types of Linear Regression**
1. **Simple Linear Regression**:
   - Models the relationship between a single feature and the target variable.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
   - Models the relationship between multiple features and the target variable.

---

### **Assumptions of Linear Regression**
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between input features and the target is linear.
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residuals is constant.
4. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed.
5. **No Multicollinearity**: Input features are not highly correlated.

---

### **Advantages**
1. **Simple and Interpretable**:
   - Easy to implement and understand.
   - Coefficients provide insights into the importance of features.
2. **Efficient**:
   - Computationally inexpensive, suitable for small to medium-sized datasets.
3. **Foundation for Complex Models**:
   - Serves as a building block for advanced regression methods.

---

### **Limitations**
1. **Sensitive to Outliers**:
   - Outliers can disproportionately affect the model.
2. **Assumes Linearity**:
   - Poor performance if the relationship between features and target is non-linear.
3. **Overfitting in High Dimensions**:
   - Regularization may be required to handle datasets with many features.

---

### **Applications**
1. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - Forecasting sales, prices, or trends.
2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Estimating probabilities or impacts in finance and insurance.
3. **Marketing**:
   - Evaluating relationships between ad spending and sales.
4. **Health Analytics**:
   - Predicting outcomes based on patient data.

### **Evaluation Metrics**
To assess the performance of a linear regression model, the following metrics are commonly used:
1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
   \[
   \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \big( y_i - \hat{y}_i \big)^2
   \]
2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
   \[
   \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \big| y_i - \hat{y}_i \big|
   \]
3. **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**:
   \[
   R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SS}_{\text{res}}}{\text{SS}_{\text{tot}}}
   \]
   Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

Mean Squared Error (MSE):
MSE=1mâˆ‘i=1m(yiâˆ’y^i)2
MSE=m1â€‹i=1âˆ‘mâ€‹(yiâ€‹âˆ’y^â€‹iâ€‹)2
Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
MAE=1mâˆ‘i=1mâˆ£yiâˆ’y^iâˆ£
MAE=m1â€‹i=1âˆ‘mâ€‹
â€‹yiâ€‹âˆ’y^â€‹iâ€‹
â€‹
R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):
R2=1âˆ’SSresSStot
R2=1âˆ’SStotâ€‹SSresâ€‹â€‹

### **Conclusion**
Linear regression is a foundational algorithm in machine learning. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a go-to solution for problems involving continuous target variables, provided the assumptions of linearity and independence are met. For non-linear relationships, techniques like polynomial regression or advanced models like decision trees may be better suited.
